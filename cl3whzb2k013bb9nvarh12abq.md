## How to install MySQL on Windows or MacBook

As a developer we all go through this. Every time we start working on a new machine we get a headache of installing each and every software like IDE , MySQL, Mango DB, etc. And we often forget some steps while installing software on a new machine and get error and stuck on it. So, it would be great if we have simple steps to follow and install these software. 

Today I am going to describe all the steps you required while installing MySQL.


- 
 First of all search MySQL download on [Google](google.com) then click on first link you get from mysql.com as shown below.
